<h1 style="text-align: center;">(AOE) Profile Card Generator</h1>

A simple Go HTTP Server for handling multipart-form POST
requests and generating a profile card PDF from the provided data.

Please be advised: This project was merely meant to be an exercise for myself during my introduction to Go and is therefore by no means considered a finished project.
